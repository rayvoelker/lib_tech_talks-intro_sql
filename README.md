Intro to SQL functionalities in Sierra
---
The back end of III's Sierra allows us to do much more than we were able to before. Ray Voelker will talk about how the IT staff (or you!) can write SQL queries that will give you the data you really want. For instance, you could do a DVD collection analysis that gives you the number of copies, number of circs, publishers, etc., and you can run the query again as often as you want. Or you can take that same query, replace some of the parameters, and you have a whole new report!
